# FPGA-Brushless-DC-Motor
In this project, the aim was to program Basys 3 for Brushless DC Motor. At first the motor started to turn in 90 RPM which is the minimum speed of motor. Then hall effect part was opened. After that motor started to turn smnoothly. Simultaneously, speed of motor showed on seven segment display. Furthermore, I integrated a turning back feature on VHDL code.
